## Navigating the Filesystem

Complete each of following steps, **in order** :

1. Create a new directory called `quiz` inside the root directory of this repository (`cli-08-assessment`).

2. Create a new file inside `quiz` called `rhyme.txt`.

3. Open `rhyme.txt` using Sublime (via the terminal) and add the following text:

 "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain."

Once you've done this, save the file and quit.

4. Make a directory inside `quiz` called `temp`. Inside it, create a new blank file called `temp.md`.

5. Navigate back up to `quiz`, and delete the `temp` directory (with `temp.md` inside of it).
Use `ls` to show the contents of `quiz` - was `temp` deleted?

## Absolute and Relative Paths

Open up this file in your text editor, and write your answers below (where indicated).

1. Is `/Users/blah_blah/Desktop` a relative path or an absolute path? How do you know?

Absolute. It is exactly where you will find it.<!-- Answer Starts Here -->

<!-- Answer Ends Here -->

2. Suppose that we're working on a project, and we want to use a font that's being hosted somewhere on the internet. Would we use an absolute or relative path to refer to it? Why?

<!-- Answer Starts Here -->Relative.  When someone else views that font, they won't be able to find it if you use an absolute path on your computer.

<!-- Answer Ends Here -->

3. Now suppose that we have an image file living inside our project. Would we refer to it with an absolute or relative path? Why?

<!-- Answer Starts Here -->Relative, so everyone can use it.

<!-- Answer Ends Here -->

You're done! Refer back to README.md.
